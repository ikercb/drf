# Density Random Forest

An implementation from scratch of a new random forest algorithm to solve the problem of density estimation.
This task is unsupervised so neither the Gini impurity nor the information gain can be used. In this case, 
the best split is selected by minimizing the integrated squared error (ISE).

This project is a work in progress for my master's thesis: "Density-based clustering with Random Forest".
